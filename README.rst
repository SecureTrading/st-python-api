Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

You don't need the source code to install this package, the recommended way is to use PIP running the following command:

* pip install --upgrade securetrading

Alternatively you can download the project and install it locally.

Supported
^^^^^^^^^

We recommend using at least Python 2.7.9  as any version prior to this may give a SNI warning when the library is instantiated. For further information please look at http://urllib3.readthedocs.org/en/latest/security.html#installing-urllib3-with-sni-support-and-certificates and http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/community/faq/ information regarding SNI. Additionally version "2.9" of the "requests" library is required, this is to ensure that the latest certificates have been installed.
